<h2><a name="PartI"></a>Part I: General Information</h2>

<h4><a name="Procedure"></a>Procedure</h4>

<p>The ICASSP 2018 paper submission and review process is being conducted in a
manner similar to previous ICASSP conferences, including the change from
previous years being an optional 5th page for references only:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Authors who wish to participate in the conference will create documents
  consisting of a complete description of their ideas and applicable research
  results in a maximum of 4 pages for technical content including figures and
  possible references, <strong>and with one additional optional 5th page containing
  only references</strong>.</li>

  <li>Submit the paper and copyright form electronically. This paper
  submission must be submitted in final, publishable form before the submission
  deadline listed below.</li>

	<li>Check the ICASSP 2018 website for the status of your paper.</li>

  <li>Paper submissions will be reviewed by experts selected by the conference
  committee for their demonstrated knowledge of particular topics.  The
  progress and results of the review process will be posted on this website,
  and authors will also be notified of the review results by email.</li>

  <li>If your paper is accepted, it will be assigned to either a lecture or a
  poster session by the program committee. Prepare a lecture or poster
  presentation accordingly, following the guidelines included in this
  document.</li>

</ul>

<p>The review process is being conducted entirely online. To make the review
process easy for the reviewers, and to assure that the paper submissions will
be readable through the online review system, we ask that authors submit paper
documents that are formatted according to the Paper Kit instructions included
here.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Requirements"></a>Requirements</h4>

<p>Papers may be no longer than 5 pages, including all text, figures, and
references, and the 5th page may contain only references.</p>

<p>Papers must be submitted by the deadline date. There will be no exceptions.</p>

<p>Accepted papers <strong>MUST</strong> be presented at the conference by one
of the authors. One of the authors <strong>MUST</strong> register for the conference at
one of the non-student rates offered, and <strong>MUST</strong> register before
the deadline given for author registration. Failure to register before the
deadline will result in automatic withdrawal of your paper from the conference
proceedings and program. A single registration may cover up to four (4) papers.</p>

<p style="border: 2px solid gray; background-color: #ddd; padding: 0.5em 1em;">ICASSP 2018 requires that each accepted paper be presented by
one of the authors in-person at the conference site according to the schedule
published. Any paper accepted into the technical program, but not presented
on-site will be withdrawn from the official proceedings archived on IEEE
Xplore.</p>

<h5>Document Preparation</h5>

<a name="FAQ1"></a>
<p><strong>1)</strong> The LaTeX Template, Microsoft Word Template, and 
PDF Sample files do not have the exact margins or measurements as those 
described in the paper kit. What are the correct measurements?</p>

<p><strong>1-Ans)</strong> The Paper Kit description should be 
considered the final word. Because of software version differences, 
installed font differences, and other system-specific issues, the final 
PDF or Postscript file that you create from the given templates may not 
exactly match the sample manuscript found in the paper kit. The 
measurements given in these templates and in the official Paper Kit 
description are not intended to be followed with extreme precision. 
However, the general structure and layout of the document should be 
substantially the same as the templates and sample manuscript. This 
means: the title should appear at the top of the first page, the author 
list should appear beneath the title, the first paragraph of the 
document should be the abstract section, the document should be in 
two-column format with reasonable margins and column spacing, and the 
font size should be no smaller than 9pt.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ2"></a>
<p><strong>2)</strong> I need more time to complete my manuscript; I cannot complete it by the published deadline. Can I have an extension?</p>

<p><strong>2-Ans)</strong> The published manuscript submission deadline 
was selected so that submitted manuscripts may receive sufficient and 
thorough reviews and so that presenting authors of accepted papers will 
have sufficient time to arrange for travel to the event site. By 
granting an extension, the rest of the development of the technical 
program would be delayed. The deadline for submission of manuscripts is 
known well in advance, thus, no extension will be granted for any 
reason.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ3"></a>
<p><strong>3)</strong> My manuscript has authors from more than 2 
affiliations; My manuscript has several authors. But the LaTeX template 
supports only 2 authors or my list of many authors is too long to fit on
 one line. How should I list multiple authors in the heading of my 
manuscript?</p>

<p><strong>3-Ans)</strong> There are several formats commonly used for 
formatting author lists of 3 or more authors or where there are 3 or 
more different affiliations for authors. The preferred method is to list
 the author names with identifying marks (superscript numbers, for 
example) and then a legend below the name list with the respective 
affiliation descriptions. Be sure that the author list does not exceed 
the margins of the page. An example is provided:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">\name{Author Name$^{\star \dagger}$ \qquad Author Name$^{\star}$ \qquad Author Name$^{\dagger}$}

\address{$^{\star}$ Affiliation Number One \\
    $^{\dagger}$}Affiliation Number Two</pre>

<p>If your plain author list is too long to fit on one line, and you find that the line-break command </p><pre>\\ </pre> does not work in the <pre>\name</pre> block, try wrapping the name list in a <pre>{tabular}</pre> block, as below:<p></p>

<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">\name{\begin{tabular}{c}Name First, Name Second, Name Third, Name Fourth \\
Name Fifth, Name Sixth, Name Seventh, Name Eighth\end{tabular}}</pre>


<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<h5>Manuscript Submission</h5>

<a name="FAQ4"></a>
<p><strong>4)</strong> How will I know if my submission is valid for review?</p>

<p><strong>4-Ans)</strong> All submitted manuscripts will be inspected 
for general adherence to the paper kit guidelines (i.e. page count 
limits, page margins, font problems) and submission procedure (i.e. the 
title on the uploaded file matches the title typed into the web 
submission form, the author list on the uploaded file matches the author
 list typed into the web submission form, etc.). Authors designated as 
"contact author" will be notified by email only if any problems are 
found. The status of your submission can be checked online at any time 
using the assigned paper number and an access code.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ5"></a>
<p><strong>5)</strong> Why did my submission fail document inspection? Can I try again?</p>

<p><strong>5-Ans)</strong> There are many reasons why a submitted 
manuscript might fail the "inspection" process. The inspection failure 
notification email will contain a description of the problem. The 
"Revise an already-submitted paper" link on the website will allow for 
revising of submissions which did not pass inspection. Typically 3-4 
days is allowed for corrections to be made in such cases. The most 
common reasons for inspection failure are:
  </p><ul>
    <li>The author list shown on the uploaded document file does not 
match the author list typed into the online form. These two lists MUST 
MATCH EXACTLY in author names and the order in which these names appear 
on the uploaded document.</li>
    <li>Page numbers appear on the uploaded file. Do not include page numbers in the submitted manuscript.</li>
    <li>The author list on the uploaded manuscript is blank. Unless 
explicitly specified otherwise, the review process is not 
"double-blind". The submitted manuscript should be in publish-ready 
format.</li>
  </ul><p></p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ6"></a>
<p><strong>6)</strong> How can I withdraw or cancel my submission?</p>

<p><strong>6-Ans)</strong> Send an email to general support email 
address requesting the withdrawal of the manuscript. This email MUST 
include the assigned paper ID and should include in the cc: line all of 
the authors currently listed on the manuscript. If the latter is not 
done, then a note will be sent to all authors requesting confirmation of
 the request as withdrawal of a manuscript can only be done on the 
agreement of all authors.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ7"></a>
<p><strong>7)</strong> I recently discovered that I am required to 
acknowledge the sponsor of my research in order to receive funding, but 
the deadline for submitting the final manuscript has passed. What should
 I do?</p>

<p><strong>7-Ans)</strong> The deadlines for final manuscript submission
 are firm and are chosen to allow sufficent time for the preparation and
 production of the conference proceedings in time for distribution at 
the event. Be sure to check with financial sponsors before the final 
manuscript submission deadline concerning this potential requirement.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<h5>Registration</h5>

<a name="FAQ8"></a>
<p><strong>8)</strong> The paper kit and web site state that every paper
 must have an author registered by a certain date. If I am the 
presenting author of multiple papers, does this mean I should register 
multiple times?</p>

<p><strong>8-Ans)</strong> No, each valid registration to the conference
 can be linked with up to 4 accepted papers. Note that the registered 
person should be a named author on any papers he or she is linking with 
the registration.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ9"></a>
<p><strong>9)</strong> The web site states that only non-student 
registrations can be linked with accepted papers. I am a student and 
will be the presenting author; how should I register?</p>

<p><strong>9-Ans)</strong> The policy is that each paper should be 
linked with a non-student-rate registration. Students who are the only 
presenting authors of papers should choose one of the non-student rates.
 For example, a student who is an IEEE Graduate Student Member and is 
the only attending author of a paper should choose to register at the 
IEEE Member rate. A student who is not a member of IEEE in any way 
should choose to register at the Non-Member rate. Please DO NOT have an 
author who does not intend to attend register only to link papers.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ10"></a>
<p><strong>10)</strong> The members of our team have not yet decided who
 will be the one(s) to attend and present our paper(s), but the author 
registration deadline is approaching. Can we change the name of the 
person registered later on?</p>

<p><strong>10-Ans)</strong> One substitute is allowed for a 
registration. Please have the original registered person reply to the 
registration confirmation email and request to transfer his or her 
registration to someone else. Be sure to include the full contact 
information for the substitute. Such requests must be received no later 
than 2 weeks prior to the start of the event.</p>

<div class="sepsmall"></div>

<a name="FAQ11"></a>
<p><strong>11)</strong> When I registered, I was not a member of IEEE, 
but I recently did join. Can I receive a refund of the difference 
between the member and non-member registration fees?</p>

<p><strong>11-Ans)</strong> No, one must be a member of IEEE at the time
 of registration in order to receive the lower registration fee benefit.
 Joining IEEE can be done online quickly and the Member Number is 
assigned within a few days in most cases.</p>

<h2><a name="PartII"></a>Part II: Preparation of the Paper</h2>

<h4><a name="DocumentFormatting"></a>Document Formatting</h4>

<p>Use the following guidelines when preparing your document:</p>

<p><span class="important">LENGTH: You are allowed a total of 5 pages for your
document. Up to 4 pages may contain technical content, figures, and references,
while the 5th page may contain only references. This is the maximum number of
pages that will be accepted, including all figures, tables, and
references.</span> Any documents that exceed the 5 page limit or have a 5th
page containing anything other than references, will be rejected.</p>

<p><strong>LANGUAGE</strong>: All proposals must be in English.</p>

<p><strong>MARGINS</strong>: Documents should be formatted for standard
<strong>letter-size (8-1/2" by 11" or 216mm by 279mm) paper</strong>. Any text
or other material outside the margins specified below will not be accepted:</p>

<ul>

  <li>All text and figures must be contained in a 178 mm x 229 mm (7 inch x 9
  inch) image area.</li>

  <li>The left margin must be 19 mm (0.75 inch).</li>

  <li>The top margin must be 25 mm (1.0 inch), except for the title page
  where it must be 35 mm (1.375 inches).</li>

  <li>Text should appear in two columns, each 86 mm (3.39 inch) wide with 6
  mm (0.24 inch) space between columns.</li>

  <li>On the first page, the top 50 mm (2") of both columns is reserved for
  the title, author(s), and affiliation(s). These items should be centered
  across both columns, starting at 35 mm (1.375 inches) from the top of the
  page.</li>

  <li>The paper abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of
  text, about 12 mm (0.5") below the title area and no more than 80 mm
  (3.125") in length. Leave 12 mm (0.5") of space between the end of the
  abstract and the beginning of the main text.</li>

</ul>

<div class="sidebar">

<p>A format sheet with the margins and placement guides is available in the
following file formats:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/PaperFormat/format.pdf">PDF file</a> (When you print this file, make sure the "shrink to fit" box is not checked!)</li>
  <li><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/PaperFormat/format.ps">PostScript file</a></li>
</ul>

<p>These files contain lines and boxes showing the margins and print areas. If
you print one of these files, then stack it atop your printed page and hold it
up to the light, you can easily check your margins to see if your print area
fits within the space allowed.</p>

</div>

<p><strong>TYPE</strong>:</p>

<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
  <p><strong>Face</strong>: To achieve the best viewing experience for the
  review process and conference proceedings, we strongly encourage authors to
  use Times-Roman or Computer Modern fonts. If a font face is used that is not
  recognized by the submission system, your proposal will not be reproduced
  correctly.</p>

  <p><strong>Size</strong>: Use a font size that is no smaller than 9 points
  throughout the paper, including figure captions. In 9-point type font,
  capital letters are 2 mm high. For 9-point type font, there should be no more
  than 3.2 lines/cm (8 lines/inch) vertically. This is a minimum spacing; 2.75
  lines/cm (7 lines/inch) will make the proposal much more readable. Larger
  type sizes require correspondingly larger vertical spacing.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>TITLE</strong>: The paper title must appear in boldface letters and
should be in ALL CAPITALS.  Do not use LaTeX math notation ($x_y$) in the title; the title must
be representable in the Unicode character set. Also try to avoid uncommon
acronyms in the title.</p>

<p><strong>AUTHOR LIST</strong>: The authors' name(s) and affiliation(s) appear
below the title in capital and lower case letters.  ICASSP does not perform blind
reviews, so be sure to include the author list in your submitted paper.
Proposals with multiple authors and affiliations may require two or more lines
for this information.  The order of the authors on the document should exactly
match in number and order the authors typed into the online submission
form.</p>

<p>The LaTeX template has instructions for listing one or two authors. 
If you need to list more than 2 authors, please use the following 
structure:</p>

<pre style="margin-left: 2em;">\name{Author Name$^{\star \dagger}$ \qquad Author Name$^{\star}$ \qquad Author Name$^{\dagger}$}

\address{$^{\star}$ Affiliation Number One \\
    $^{\dagger}$}Affiliation Number Two</pre>

<p><strong>ABSTRACT</strong>: Each paper should contain an abstract of 100 to
150 words that appears at the beginning of the document. Use the same text that
is submitted electronically along with the author contact information.</p>

<p><strong>INDEX TERMS (KEYWORDS)</strong>: Enter up to 5 keywords separated
by commas..</p>

<p><strong>BODY</strong>: Major headings appear in boldface CAPITAL letters,
centered in the column. Subheadings appear in capital and lower case, either
underlined or in boldface. They start at the left margin of the column on a
separate line.  Sub-subheadings are discouraged, but if they must be used, they
should appear in capital and lower case, and start at the left margin on a
separate line. They may be underlined or in italics.</p>

<p><strong>RELATION TO PRIOR WORK (NEW)</strong>: The text of the paper should
contain discussions on how the paper's contributions are related to prior work
in the field.  It is important to put new work in context, to give credit to
foundational work, and to provide details associated with the previous work
that have appeared in the literature. This discussion may be a separate,
numbered section or it may appear elsewhere in the body of the manuscript, but
it must be present.</p>

<p>You should differentiate what is new and how your work expands on or takes a
different path from the prior studies. An example might read something to the
effect: "The work presented here has focused on the formulation of the ABC
algorithm, which takes advantage of non-uniform time-frequency domain analysis
of data. The work by Smith and Cohen [1] considers only fixed time-domain
analysis and the work by Jones et al [2] takes a different approach based on
fixed frequency partitioning. While the present study is related to recent
approaches in time-frequency analysis [3-5], it capitalizes on a new feature
space, which was not considered in these earlier studies.</p>

<p><strong>REFERENCES</strong>: List and number all bibliographical references
at the end of the paper. The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or
in order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in the text,
type the corresponding reference number in square brackets as shown at the end
of this sentence [2]. An additional final page (the fifth page, in most cases)
is allowed, but must contain only references to the prior literature.</p>

<p>The end of the document should include a list of references containing
information similar to the following example:</p>

<p style="text-indent: 2em;">[1] D. E. Ingalls, "Image Processing for Experts," IEEE Trans. ASSP, vol. ASSP-36, pp. 1932-1948, 1988.</p>

<p><strong>ILLUSTRATIONS &amp; COLOR</strong>: Illustrations must appear within
the designated margins. They may span the two columns. If possible, position
illustrations at the top of columns, rather than in the middle or at the
bottom. Caption and number every illustration. All halftone illustrations must
be clear in black and white. Since the printed proceedings will be produced in
black and white, be sure that your images are acceptable when printed in black
and white (the electronic, conference-distributed proceedings and the IEEE
Xplore proceedings will retain the colors in your document).</p>

<p><span class="important">PAGE NUMBERS: <strong>Do not put page numbers on
your document</strong>. Appropriate page numbers will be added to accepted
papers when the conference proceedings are assembled.</span></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<p>The following style files and templates are available for users of LaTeX and Microsoft Word:</p>

</ul>

<p>We recommend that you use the Word file or LaTeX files to produce your
document, since they have been set up to meet the formatting guidelines listed
above.  When using these files, double-check the paper size in your page setup
to make sure you are using the letter-size paper layout (8.5" X 11") or A4
paper layout (210mm X 297mm).  The LaTeX environment files specify suitable
margins, page layout, text, and a bibliography style.</p>

<p>In particular, with LaTeX, there are cases where the top-margin of the
resulting Postscript or PDF file does not meet the specified parameters. In
this case, you may need to add a <span style="font-family:monospace;">\topmargin=0mm</span>
command just after the <span style="font-family:monospace;">\begin{document}</span> command in your
.tex file. The spacing of the top margin is not critical, as the page contents
will be adjusted on the proceedings. The critical dimensions are the actual
width and height of the page content.</p>

<div class="sepbig"></div>

<h2><a name="PartIII"></a>Part III: Submission and Review of the Paper</h2>

followed EXACTLY</span>. The conference is required to ensure that documents
follow this specification. The requirements are enumerated in:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/PaperFormat/Author-PDF-Guide-V32.pdf">IEEE Requirements for PDF Documents v3.2</a> [PDF]</li>
</ul>

<p>Papers must be submitted in Adobe's Portable Document
Format (PDF) format.</p>

<p>PDF and Postscript files:</p>

<ul>
  <li>must not have Adobe Document Protection or Document Security enabled,</li>
  <li>must have either 'US Letter' or 'A4' sized pages,</li>
  <li>must be in first-page-first order, and</li>
  <li>must have <strong>ALL FONTS</strong> embedded and subset.</li>
</ul>

<p class="important">ALL FONTS MUST be embedded in the PDF file.
There is no guarantee that the viewers of the paper (reviewers and those who
view the electronic proceedings after publication) have the same fonts used in the
document.  If fonts are not embedded in the submission, you will be contacted
by CMS and asked to submit a file that has all fonts embedded.  Please refer to
your PDF file generation utility's user guide to find out how to embed
all fonts.</p>

<h4><a name="LaTeXInfo"></a>Information for LaTeX users</h4>

<p>Generating a PostScript file is straightforward for all LaTeX
packages we are aware of. When preparing the proposal under LaTeX, it is
preferable to use scalable fonts such as Type I, Computer Modern. However,
quite good results can be obtained with the fonts defined in the style file
recommended above (spconf.sty).</p>

<p>PDF files with Postscript Type 3 fonts are highly discouraged. PDF and
PostScript files utilizing Type 3 fonts are typically produced by the LaTeX
system and are lower-resolution bitmapped versions of the letters and figures.
It is possible to perform a few simple changes to the configuration or
command-line to produce files that use PostScript Type 1 fonts, which are a
vector representation of the letters and figures.<!-- An excellent set of
instructions is found at:--></p>

  <a href="http://www.utdallas.edu/~cantrell/online/543e.html">Creating quality Adobe PDF files from TeX with DVIPS</a>
</div>
-->

<p>For most installations of LaTeX, you can cause
<span style="font-family:monospace;">dvips</span> to output Type 1 fonts
instead of Type 3 fonts by including <span style="font-family:monospace;">-Ppdf</span> option to
<span style="font-family:monospace;">dvips</span>. The resulting Postscript file will
reference the Type 1 Computer Modern fonts, rather than embedding the bitmapped
Type 3 versions, which cause problems with printers.</p>

<p>You may also need to tell <span style="font-family: monospace;">dvips</span> to force
letter sized paper with the option: <span style="font-family: monospace;">-t letter</span>.</p>

<p>Some LaTeX installations also include <span style="font-family:monospace;">pdflatex</span>, which produces acceptable PDF files as well.</p>

</div>


<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="FileSizeLimit"></a>File Size Limit</h4>

<p>Authors will be permitted to submit a document file up to 5 MB (megabytes) in
size.  To request an exception, contact the paper submission technical support
at: <a href="mailto:papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org">papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="FileName"></a>File Name</h4>

<p>The filename of the document file should be the first author's last name,
followed by the appropriate extension (.pdf). For example, if the first
author's name is Johan Smith, you would submit your file as "smith.pdf".
<strong>The paper submission process will append the filename with a unique
identifier when it is stored on our system, so multiple submissions with the
same name will not overwrite each other and will be
distinguishable.</strong></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Submission"></a>Electronic Paper Submission</h4>

<p>When you have your document file ready, gather the following information
before entering the submission system:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Document file in PDF format</li>
	<li>Affiliation, email address, and mailing address for each author</li>
	<li>Paper title</li>
	<li>Text file containing paper abstract text, in ASCII text format (for copying and pasting into web page form)</li>
</ul>

<p>To submit your document and author information, go to the 'Paper Submission'
link on the ICASSP 2018 homepage: </p>

<p><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/">https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/</a></p>

<p>The submission system will present an entry form to allow you to enter the
paper title, abstract text, review category, and author contact information.</p>

<p>Please note that the list of review categories is very detailed. Please read
through the entire list of paper topics at <a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/PaperTopics.asp" target="_blank">https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/Papers/PaperTopics.asp</a>
before beginning your submission.</p>

<p class="important">ALL authors must be entered in the online form, and must
appear in the online form in the same order in which the authors appear on the
PDF.</p>

<p>After you submit this information, the system will display a page with the
data that you entered so that you may verify its accuracy.  If you need to
change the data to fix a mistake, you may use the back button on your browser
to return to the information entry form.  Once you approve of the data that you
have entered, you may choose your document file for upload at the bottom of the
verification page.  When you click on the button labeled 'Continue' at the
bottom of this page, the page will check the filename extension to make sure it
matches the submission criteria, then your browser will upload your file to our
server.  Depending on the size of your file and your internet connection speed,
this upload may take a few minutes.  At the end of a successful upload, you
will see a confirmation page displaying the paper number that is assigned to
you, and and email message will be sent to the corresponding authors' email
addresses to confirm that the file has been uploaded.  If you do not see the
confirmation page after uploading your file, we may not have successfully
received your file upload.  If you encounter trouble, contact the paper
submission support at: <a href="mailto:papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org">papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="CopyrightForm"></a>IEEE Copyright Transfer Form</h4>

<p>All submissions must have an IEEE Electronic Copyright form submitted before
the manuscript is allowed to be delivered to reviewers. If the submission is
not accepted, the copyright transfer form becomes null and void.</p>

<p>The electronic copyright form is digitally linked to your submission; if you
revise/update your paper's title or author list, the copyright form will still
apply. There is no need to submit a new copyright form.</p>

<p>The confirmation page that is displayed after uploading your final,
camera-ready document file will also have a link to the IEEE Electronic
Copyright Form (eCF) system. That system will guide you through a series of
questions to determine the type of copyright form required for your manuscript
and will electronically record your signature. You will have the opportunity to
download a PDF version of your electronically-signed copyright form, and both
the IEEE eCF system and the ICASSP 2018 system will send you a
confirmation of the receipt of the properly signed form.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="ReviewProcess"></a>Online Review Process</h4>

<p>Your submitted paper will be converted to PDF format by the submission
system if necessary, then visually inspected by our submission system staff to
assure that the document is readable and meets all formatting requirements to
be included in a visually pleasing and consistant proceedings publication for
ICASSP 2018.  If our submission inspectors encounter errors with your submitted
file, they will contact you to resolve the issue.  If your paper passes
inspection, it will be entered into the review process.  A committee of
reviewers selected by the conference committee will review the documents and
rate them according to quality, relevence, and correctness.  The conference
technical committee will use these reviews to determine which papers will be
accepted for presentation in the conference.  The result of the technical
committee's decision will be communicated to the submitting authors by email,
along with any reviewer comments, if any.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="MonitorStatus"></a>Monitor Your Submission Status</h4>

<p>After you submit your document, you may monitor the status of your paper as
it progresses through the submission and review process by using the Paper
Status website available at:</p>

<p><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/">https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/</a></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Notification"></a>Notification of Acceptance</h4>

<p>Authors will be notified of paper acceptance or non-acceptance by email as
close as possible to the published author notification date. The email
notification will include the presentation format chosen for your paper
(lecture or poster) and may also include the presentation date and time, if
available.</p>

<p>The notification email will include comments from the reviewers. The
conference cannot guarantee that all of the reviewers will provide the level of
comment desired by you. However, reviewers are encouraged to submit as detailed
comments as possible.</p>

<p>Because of the short amount of time between paper acceptance decisions and
the beginning of the publication process, ICASSP 2018 is not able to allow for
a two-way discourse between the authors and the reviewers of a paper. If there
appears to be a logistical error in the reviewer comments, such as the reviewer
commenting on the wrong paper, etc., please contact ICASSP 2018 at
<a href="mailto:papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org">papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org</a>.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="Revisions"></a>Accepted Paper Revisions</h4>

<p>Limited revisions to accepted papers will be allowed. In general, changes
should be limited to areas in which improvement was recommended by the
reviewers. Changes to the title and author list are not allowed except for
extraordinary circumstances. The time period allowed for revision to accepted
papers is very short and the schedule will be held strictly, so if you decide
to make revisions to your paper, be sure it is finished during the paper
revision time period.</p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="AuthorRegistration"></a>Required Author Registration</h4>

<p>Be sure that at least one author registers to attend the conference using
the online registration system available through the conference website.  Each
paper must have at least one author registered, with the <strong>payment
received</strong> by the author registration deadline (see above) to avoid
being withdrawn from the conference.</p>

<p><a href="https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/">https://2018.ieeeicassp.org/</a></p>

<div class="sep"></div>

<h4><a name="CopyrightIssues"></a>Copyright Issues for Web Publication</h4>

<p>If you plan to publish a copy of an accepted paper on the Internet by any
means, you <strong>MUST</strong> display the following IEEE copyright notice on
the first page that displays IEEE published (and copyrighted) material:</p>

<h2><a name="PartIV"></a><a name="Presentation"></a>Part IV: Preparation of the Presentation</h2>

<p>When we send the review results for your paper by email, that email message
will specify whether accepted papers have been assigned for presentation in a
poster session or lecture (oral) session.  To help authors prepare for lecture
and poster presentations, the following suggestions have been created:</p>

<a name="LecturePresentations"></a>
<h3>Lecture Presentations</h3>

<p>Presentation time is critical: each paper is allocated 20 minutes for oral
sessions. We recommend that presentation of your slides should take about 17-18
minutes, leaving 2-3 minutes for introduction, summary, and questions from the
audience. To achieve appropriate timing, organize your slides or viewgraphs
around the points you intend to make, using no more than one slide per minute.
A reasonable strategy is to allocate about 2 minutes per slide when there are
equations or important key points to make, and one minute per slide when the
content is less complex. Slides attract and hold attention, and reinforce what
you say - provided you keep them simple and easy to read. Plan on covering at
most 6 points per slide, covered by 6 to 12 spoken sentences and no more than
about two spoken minutes.</p>

<p>Make sure each of your key points is easy to explain with aid of the
material on your slides. Do not read directly from the slide during your
presentation. You shouldn't need to prepare a written speech, although it is
often a good idea to prepare the opening and closing sentences in advance. It
is <b>very</b> important that you rehearse your presentation in front of an
audience before you give your presentation at ICASSP. Presenters <b>must</b> be
sufficiently familiar with the material being presented to answer detailed
questions from the audience. In addition, the presenter must contact the
Session Chair in advance of the presenter's session.</p>

<p>A computer-driven slideshow for use with a data projector is recommended for
your talk at ICASSP. All presentation rooms will be equipped with a computer, a
data projector, a microphone (for large rooms), and a lectern. If you need any
other audio or visual equipment, such as a PAL or NTSC VHS player, or 35mm
slide projector, please send a request for such equipment by email to
<a href="mailto:papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org">papers@2018.ieeeicassp.org</a>. Such requests
must be received by one month before the conference date.  Failure to make
prior arrangements may mean that the equipment will not be available to
you.</p>

<a name="PosterPresentations"></a>
<h3>Poster Presentations</h3>

<p>Poster sessions are a good medium for authors to present papers and meet
with interested attendees for in-depth technical discussions. In addition,
attendees find the poster sessions a good way to sample many papers in parallel
sessions. Thus it is important that you display your message clearly and
noticeably to attract people who might have an interest in your paper.</p>

<p>Your poster should cover the key points of your work. It need not, and
should not, attempt to include all the details; you can describe them in person
to people who are interested. The ideal poster is designed to attract
attention, provide a brief overview of your work, and initiate discussion.
Carefully and completely prepare your poster well in advance of the conference.
Try tacking up the poster before you leave for the conference to see what it
will look like and to make sure that you have all of the necessary pieces.</p>

<!--
<div><a href="PosterBoardSpecifications.pdf"><img src="PosterBoardSpecifications.png" style="width: 650px; height: auto; border: 1px solid black;" /></a></div>

<p>For your poster, a board will be provided which measures 96 inches wide by 48 inches high
(approximately 244cm wide by 122cm high).  Push tacks or velcro adhesive
will be provided at the conference to mount your poster to the board.</p>
-->

<p>For your poster, a board will be provided; dimensions to be posted here later.</p>

<p>The title of your poster should appear at the top in CAPITAL letters about
25mm high. Below the title put the author(s)' name(s) and affiliation(s). The
flow of your poster should be from the top left to the bottom right. Use arrows
to lead your viewer through the poster. Use color for highlighting and to make
your poster more attractive.  Use pictures, diagrams, cartoons, figures, etc.,
rather than text wherever possible. Try to state your main result in 6 lines or
less, in lettering about 15mm high so that people can read the poster from a
distance. The smallest text on your poster should be at least 9mm high, and the
important points should be in a larger size. Use a sans-serif font (such as
"cmss" in the Computer Modern family or the "Helvetica" PostScript font) to
make the print easier to read from a distance.</p>

<p>Make your poster as self-explanatory as possible. This will save your
efforts for technical discussions. There will not be any summaries given at the
beginning of the poster sessions at ICASSP 2018, so authors need not prepare
any overhead slides for their poster presentations. You may bring additional
battery-operated audio or visual aids to enhance your presentation.</p>

<p>Prepare a short presentation of about 5 or 10 minutes that you can
periodically give to those assembled around your poster throughout the 2 hour
poster session. If possible, more than one author should attend the session to
aid in presentations and discussions, and to provide the presenters with the
chance to rest or briefly view other posters.</p>
